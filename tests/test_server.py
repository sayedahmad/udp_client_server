"""UDP Server Unit Tests

This module provides unit tests for the UDP server module.
The tests cover the functionality of the server class methods
including message receiving, sending, server running, and stopping.

These tests are placeholders and will be implemented in the future.

Tests:
    - test_receive_messages_from_clients: Placeholder test for the receive_messages_from_clients method.
    - test_send_response_to_client: Placeholder test for the send_response_to_client method.
    - test_send_user_message_to_last_client: Placeholder test for the send_user_message_to_last_client method.
    - test_run_server: Placeholder test for the run_server method.
    - test_stop_server: Placeholder test for the stop_server method.
