"""UDP Client Unit Tests

This module provides unit tests for the UDP client module.
The tests cover the functionality of the client class methods
including message receiving, sending, client running, and stopping.

These tests are placeholders and will be implemented in the future.

Tests:
    - test_receive_message: Placeholder test for the receive_message method.
    - test_send_message: Placeholder test for the send_message method.
    - test_run: Placeholder test for the run method.
    - test_stop: Placeholder test for the stop method.
